      # Before careful when using associations, rails will make a query for

      # to O(n**2). Use the `.includes` method on an ActiveRecord to eager load
      # an association. In this case, we eager load users that own a question
      # to display their full names in the json response.

      # When using jBuilder to server JSON, make sure that you do
      # not render with `render json: @question`. This would instead serialize
      # @question (transforming into json) and send that as a response.
      # Instead use render as you to send a template.
